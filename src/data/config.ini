# Some settings don't actually require you to restart the bot in order to load the settings again. For an example, strings.
# Send /config to the bot to see how it works, it will not respond if you're not an admin, or not a mod.
# Delimiters are just a comma, no space after it.

[STRINGS]
user_took_quiz: Hello, it seems like you've taken the quiz before. There's nothing for you to do here. I'll make sure to try to unrestrict you again just to make sure you're unrestricted. 
start_message: Hello, {username}
    • the test has *20* randomly picked quizzes (per user, sending `/{start}` again will get you the same questions) from the database, getting a score of `{correct_answers}/{questions_count}` is enough.
    • if you fail this test, you'd have to wait 3 days until you retake it.

    *Note*: to complete a test, just click on ">" when the page number is [{questions_count}/{questions_count}], but all the answers have to be answered. Any unanswered question means the test isn't done yet.

    There's something wrong with a specific question? Or the question's answer is incorrect in the database? Message @dizaztor with the `ID` of the question, and I'll take a look.

    Click _Ready_ to start, good luck
no: No.
ready: Ready
unknown_chat: Sorry, I will not work for this group (`{ID}`)
new_member_bot: Cool, I'll work for this group. Make me an admin though!
send_me_start: Send me [start](https://t.me/GateBot?start=1) to start your test, if you get a score of {correct_answers}/{questions_count} (`{calc_percentage}`), you'll be allowed to chat here.
failed_match: Regex match failed. Uh, it's as simple as: `/edit #whatever [whatever]`.
    It's very forgiving, saying `#whatver123!!@#`, will only get `#whatever123`. `[]` <- anything inside those brackets is possible, you don't need to escape anything.
no_start: {username} hasn't sent me `/${COMMANDS:start}` for ${USER:check_sent_start} ${USER:check_unit} :(, I'm kicking them out.
correct_choice: Correct!
wrong_choice: Wrong!
unanswered_choice: Unanswered.
already_chosen: You've already chosen an answer in another test.
enough_correct: Nice! Welcome to the community.
unanswered_questions: There are some unanswered questions, go back and answer them.
has_to_wait: Sorry, you have to wait ${USER:failed_user_wait} seconds now.
